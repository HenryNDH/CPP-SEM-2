            <h1>Two Strap Sandals</h1>
            <p>Witnessing a recent surge in popularity, two-strap sandals are based loosely on the design of classic Birkenstock sandals. <br>
                As the name suggests, this footwear for women comes with two wide cross-straps that wrap horizontally around the foot. A pair would mostly feature a slip-on design, although slingback two-strap sandals are common as well.</p>
