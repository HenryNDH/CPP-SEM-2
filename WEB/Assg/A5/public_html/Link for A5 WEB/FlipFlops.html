            <h1>Flip Flops</h1>
            <p>These don't really warrant much of an explanation. The most practical pair of shoes every woman must own, flip-flops are ideal everyday sandals, comprising of a flat sole. <br>
                These shoes for women feature a Y-shaped strap starting from the front of the sole and ending at the sides. There's no dearth of flip-flop designs in the market, encompassing everything between regular rubber to glittery metallic straps. </p>
